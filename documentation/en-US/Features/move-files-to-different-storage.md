BeyondCloudConnector allows to move files between two cloud storages (for example, to use a more suitable cloud storage or to save costs).  

<!-- :::info   -->
**Increased System Load**  
Note that copying files between two records ties up a lot of system resources. The system may become busy if a large number of files are copied, i.e. operation may be impaired. Do not perform this function with large amounts of data and, if possible, outside opening or business hours.
