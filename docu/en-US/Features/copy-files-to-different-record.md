If you want to move multiple files in dropzones to another record (dropzone), you can upload the files manually or use the cloud file import entries. In this case, you copy the files to the new record, and all the files remain at the copy location.  

<!-- :::info   -->  
**Increased System Load**  
Note that copying files between two records ties up a lot of system resources. The system may become busy if a large number of files are copied, i.e. operation may be impaired. Do not perform this function with large amounts of data and, if possible, outside opening or business hours.
