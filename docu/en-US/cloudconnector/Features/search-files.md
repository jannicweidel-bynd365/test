1. Click **Show Record** in the menu bar to navigate directly to the record.  
1. You can open the file you are looking for in the FactBox (**ALT+F2**) in the Dropzone. Click on the eye symbol next to the file name.  

You have found your file. If the file cannot be accessed via the Dropzone, this may be because the file has been deleted from the cloud storage, but the link is still stored in Business Central. For more information, see the chapter [Delete Files](delete-files.md).
